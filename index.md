        <p>A resource to help answer to common technical questions from .NET open source project owners and maintainers.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The goal of this website is to bring together the wisdom and best practices spread across discussions in GitHub, StackOverflow and Twitter into one central place, and to distill it down to a set of common recommendations. We want to help the .NET community to produce high quality, stable .NET libraries for all developers.</p>

        <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
        <p>The Book of .NET OSS provides a brief description of each topic to introduce why it is important, and then gives a list of recommendations for your OSS project using <strong>Do</strong>, <strong>Consider</strong>, <strong>Avoid</strong> and <strong>Do not</strong>. The wording of each recommendation indicates how strongly it should be followed. For example a <strong>Do</strong> recommendation is one that should almost always be followed:</p>
        <p><strong>✓ DO</strong> choose an <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">OSS license</a>.</p>
        <p>On the other hand <strong>Consider</strong> recommendations should generally be followed, but there are legitimate exceptions to the rule and you should not feel bad about not following the guidance:</p>
        <p><strong>✓ CONSIDER</strong> using SemVer to version your NuGet package</p>
        <p><strong>Do not</strong> indicates something you should almost never do:</p>
        <p><strong>✗ DO NOT</strong> publish strong-named and non-strong-named versions of your project, e.g. <code>Contoso.Api</code> and <code>Contoso.Api.StrongNamed</code>.</p>
        <p>And finally less strong, <strong>avoid</strong> recommendations are something this is not a good idea, but breaking the rule sometimes makes sense:</p>
        <p><strong>✗ AVOID</strong> NuGet package references that demand an exact version.</p>
